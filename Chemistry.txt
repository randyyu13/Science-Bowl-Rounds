11) CHEMISTRY   Short Answer   A reaction between two solutions A and B has a rate constant
k of 1. If A increases from 2.0 molar to 4.0 molar and B is held constant, the reaction rate is
doubled. If B goes from 2.0 molar to 4.0 molar and A is held constant, the reaction rate is
quadrupled. What is the overall reaction order?
ANSWER: 3 (ACCEPT: THIRD)
